# BTCxCRYPTOFUZZ

This software generates a private key and from this a mnemonic phrase. The private key will be decrypted to the public key and checked if this public key (aka. address) is in the btc500.txt

The difference to some other projects is here: we are using cryptofuzz which is actually around 6 times faster.
